honeywell-tcc-api
=================

An UNOFFICIAL API to the Honeywell Total Connect Comfort line of connected thermostats. Based off of a similar script written in Python by brad@bradgoodman.com.

== Warning ==

A warning to anyone using this. This is in a PRE-ALPHA state. I wouldn't use this to control my home yet, and I wouldn't suggest you to do so either. I'm open to pull requests to help enhance this API.

If Honeywell ever gives me an API key, well, then maybe I'll use that. Until then, this will have to do.
